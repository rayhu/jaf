# About Justice Access Foundation

---

## Legal Identity

Justice Access Foundation (JAF) is organized and operates under three distinct legal frameworks:

**1. California State Law**
JAF is incorporated as a California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation under the California Nonprofit Corporation Law (Cal. Corp. Code §§ 5110 et seq.). The organization is registered with the California Secretary of State and the California Attorney General's Registry of Charitable Trusts.

**2. Federal Tax Law**
JAF has obtained recognition from the Internal Revenue Service as a tax-exempt organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

**3. Public Charity Classification**
JAF is classified as a public charity — not a private foundation — under Internal Revenue Code Section 509(a)(1) in conjunction with Section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi). This classification reflects JAF's broad public support base and ongoing compliance with the IRS public support test.

## Public Charity Classification

JAF's status as a public charity, as distinguished from a private foundation, is established and maintained through:

- Broad public support derived from a diverse base of individual donors, institutional funders, and governmental grants
- Compliance with the IRS public support test, which requires that at least one-third of total support be received from qualifying public sources
- Adherence to the concentration limit, under which no single source contributes more than 70% of total public support
- Annual compliance reporting through IRS Form 990

This classification subjects JAF to a higher standard of public accountability and donor diversification requirements, while providing enhanced legal protections and full public charity recognition.

## Governance Independence

JAF is governed by an independent volunteer Board of Directors. Governance independence is maintained through:

- Board composition requirements that preclude any single donor, funder, or affiliated entity from holding a controlling interest
- A formal conflict of interest policy requiring annual disclosure and recusal
- Prohibition on board compensation — no director, officer, or board member receives remuneration
- Quarterly board meetings to review program performance, financial position, and compliance status
- Sole board authority over organizational direction, program priorities, and resource allocation

JAF's governance structure is designed to ensure that charitable mission directs organizational activity — not the preferences of any external party.

---

## Separation from Commercial Entities

JAF maintains strict institutional, operational, and financial separation from any commercial or for-profit entity. This separation is maintained through:

- Separate legal incorporation with its own board, officers, and governing documents
- A dedicated nonprofit bank account with no commingling of funds with any commercial entity
- An independent financial oversight process conducted by the board
- Written policies prohibiting any arrangement under which a commercial entity controls, benefits from, or directs JAF's charitable operations
- Annual certification by board officers of compliance with separation requirements

No commercial entity holds any governance authority over JAF. No program, grant, or donation directs charitable resources toward commercial benefit.

---

## Geographic Focus

JAF's charitable programs are focused on serving individuals and families in the State of California. As a California nonprofit public benefit corporation, JAF's organizational framework is grounded in California law, and its programs are designed to address access-to-justice gaps within California's legal and administrative systems.

## Commitment to Due Process

Access to due process — the procedural right to be heard, informed, and fairly treated within the legal system — is a cornerstone of JAF's mission. JAF does not take positions on political or legislative matters. JAF's commitment to due process is institutional and procedural: ensuring that individuals within the California legal system have access to accurate information, fair procedures, and appropriate referrals to qualified legal professionals when representation is needed.

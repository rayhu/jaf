- The Board of Directors reviews all financial activity at each quarterly meeting
- Donor names and contribution amounts are not publicly disclosed beyond IRS requirements

## Tax Receipt Compliance

All donations of $250 or more will receive a written acknowledgment from JAF in compliance with IRS requirements under IRC Section 170(f)(8). The acknowledgment will state:

- The date and amount of the contribution
- A description of any goods or services provided in exchange (for quid pro quo contributions above $75, a good faith fair market value estimate will be provided)
- Confirmation that no goods or services were provided in exchange, where applicable

JAF's federal Employer Identification Number (EIN) is [TBD]. Donors should retain their acknowledgment for tax purposes. JAF does not provide tax advice. Donors are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the deductibility of their contributions.

## Governance Independence

The receipt of any donation — regardless of amount — does not confer any right to influence JAF's governance, program decisions, or operational activities. The Board of Directors retains sole and exclusive authority over all organizational decisions. This principle is documented in JAF's Bylaws and confirmed in all donor acknowledgment communications.

JAF is an independent public charity. No donor, funder, or commercial entity controls or influences organizational governance.
